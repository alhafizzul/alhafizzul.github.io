Hello everyone 👋

Welcome to my personal blog.  
I make this page as a place to **write down all the things I have learned**.

Before, I only explore, learn something, get some certificates, and then everything just gone because I didn’t write it down. Now I realize that **writing notes is very important** for the future.

By writing, I can:

- Look back at what I already learned
- See how far my journey has gone
- Use it as a benchmark for my personal progress

Besides for myself, I also hope this blog can be useful for other people. Maybe it can become **beneficial knowledge** and even my small **charity (amal jariyah)** in the future. 🙏

Thank you for visiting, and let’s continue this learning journey together 🚀
