Hello everyone 👋,  
Let me introduce myself. My name is **Alhafiz Zhurrahman**, but you can just call me **Zhurrahman**.

I graduated from **Computer Engineering** at **Universitas Andalas, Padang** in 2024, and Alhamdulillah I got the award as the best graduate in my department.

During my study, I explored many IT topics:

- **Programming**: web apps, mobile apps, --Flutter etc.
- **Embedded System** : Arduino, etc.
- **Machine Learning / AI**: my capstone project was about detecting disease in chili plants by analyzing soil condition and giving recommendations for treatment
- **Networking**: I earned the **MTCNA certification** from MikroTik

After that, I found my big interest in **Cybersecurity** 🔐.  
I joined a cybersecurity bootcamp from Merdeka Siber, explored bug hunting and got appreciation from a government CSIRT, and also learned more about web security.

Currently, I am working at a company where I handle a tool called **Securiti.ai**. It is a data privacy platform that helps organizations manage their data and stay compliant with privacy laws like **UU PDP** in Indonesia.

In the future, I want to keep exploring security — both **red team and blue team** sides. I will continue learning as much as I can, and I will document everything here on this blog.

If anyone is interested to give me an opportunity in your company, you can contact me at:
